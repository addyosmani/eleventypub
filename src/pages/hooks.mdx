## Class components

Before Hooks were introduced in React, we had to use class components in order to add state and lifecycle methods to components. A typical class component in React can look something like:

```js/
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  /* Adding state and binding custom methods */
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = { ... }

    this.customMethodOne = this.customMethodOne.bind(this)
    this.customMethodTwo = this.customMethodTwo.bind(this)
  }

  /* Lifecycle Methods */
  componentDidMount() { ...}
  componentWillUnmount() { ... }

  /* Custom methods */
  customMethodOne() { ... }
  customMethodTwo() { ... }

  render() { return { ... }}
}

```

### Understanding ES2015 classes

Since class components were the only component that could handle state and lifecycle methods before React Hooks, we often ended up having to refactor functional components into a class components, in order to add the extra functionality.

In this example, we have a simple `div` that functions as a button.

```js/
function Button() {
  return <div className="btn">disabled</div>;
}
```

Instead of always displaying `disabled`, we want to change it to `enabled` when the user clicks on the button, and add some extra CSS styling to the button when that happens.

In order to do that, we need to add state to the component in order to know whether the status is `enabled` or `disabled`. This means that we'd have to refactor the functional component entirely, and make it a class component that keeps track of the button's state.

```js/
export default class Button extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { enabled: false };
  }

  render() {
    const { enabled } = this.state;
    const btnText = enabled ? "enabled" : "disabled";

    return (
      <div
        className={`btn enabled-${enabled}`}
        onClick={() => this.setState({ enabled: !enabled })}
      >
        {btnText}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Perfect! We can use this custom hook in our input application. Let's log to the console whenever the user presses the `q`, `l` or `w` key.
