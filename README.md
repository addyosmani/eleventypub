# eleventypub

This project uses vanilla [11ty](https://11ty.io), along with some pre and post processing, to build an EPUB fileset. Options to validate and run accessibility checks.

## Quickstart
Clone this repo and start editing:

    $ git clone https://github.com/marisademeglio/eleventypub.git
    $ cd eleventypub
    $ npm install


Go to `src/pages`. Edit the pages there or make your own, following the examples.

Go to `src/toc.md` and fill in the table of contents, leave `auto: true` on and have it autogenerated

Go to `src/cover.md` and make a cover page.

In the terminal:

    $ npm run build

Your EPUB fileset is in `build/epub`.

If you do what it says under [Configure Tools](#configure-tools) and then you can run:

    $ npm run all

To build, validate, save, and run accessibility checks. Output from all appears in `build`

## Configure Tools

- Download and unzip [EPUBCheck](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck)
- Install [Ace by DAISY](https://daisy.github.io/ace).
- Install [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all)

Add the path to your EPUBCheck jar in [`package.json`](https://github.com/marisademeglio/eleventypub/blob/5af185071780aa650ea79939b671177e1db3591f/package.json#L41-L43).

## Conventions

You have as much freedom as you have with 11ty to mix and match templates and options.

This project uses the following conventions:

- `pages/`: for chapter files
  - `pages.json` contains front matter options for files in `pages/`:
    - `layout: page.njk`
    - `EPUBRoot: ../..`
    - `tags: pages`
- `toc.md`: Table of contents. Front matter options:
  - `auto: (true|false)`: autogenerate the TOC or use the content in this file
  - `layout`: layout template
  - `EPUBRoot: '..'`: relative path to the root of the EPUB
- `cover.md`: Cover file. Front matter options:
  - `layout`: layout template
  - `EPUBRoot: '..'`: relative path to the root of the EPUB
- `index.md`: This becomes the package document. It's empty except for the front matter options:
  - `layout`: layout template
- `_data`: publication data that ends up in the package document and elsewhere
  - `metadata.json`: as many `dc` terms, `properties`, and `links` as you want.
  - `pub.json`: `toc`, `cover`, and `readingOrder`_(optional)_ 
- `resources`: Fonts, CSS, images, etc; basically, anything you want listed in the manifest and copied over.

This project does not guarantee a valid EPUB. Go to [configure tools](#configure-tools) and run EPUBCheck.

## Scripts
- `build`: create the EPUB fileset
- `epubcheck`: run EPUBCheck on the output
- `save`: run EPUBCheck and if valid, save an EPUB file
- `ace`: run the Ace accessibility checker. The report will be in `build/report`
- `pretty`: run an XML-prettifier on `package.opf` and all `xhtml` files.
- `all`: build, prettify, save, and run ace

## FAQ

### Can I use other formats for my templates?

Yes absolutely, you can do whatever you can do with 11ty, which is a lot. Note that this project is configured to [save XHTML from Markdown files](https://github.com/marisademeglio/eleventypub/blob/5af185071780aa650ea79939b671177e1db3591f/.eleventy.js#L22), and in the `postbuild` step, all `html` files are [renamed to `xhtml`](https://github.com/marisademeglio/eleventypub/blob/5af185071780aa650ea79939b671177e1db3591f/postbuild.js#L16). So, whatever you try, it's up to you to make sure that your output is valid. Be sure to [configure your tools](#configure-tools) so you can run EPUBCheck.

### What are the TOC options?

Point to your TOC file in `pub.json`. Point to the final output, e.g. `toc/index.html`, not the input.

In this basic example, the TOC is the file generated by [`src/toc.md`](https://github.com/marisademeglio/eleventypub/blob/master/src/toc.md):

```
---
layout: toc.njk
title: Table of contents
EPUBRoot: ".."
auto: true
---
1. If the auto option were false
1. I would make a manual TOC here
1. But since auto is true, this all gets ignored.
```

`auto: true` the TOC will be autogenerated. Each chapter file will get an entry with its title. I never said we were fancy.

`auto: false`: you provide everything that's going to go between `<nav>` and `</nav>` in your TOC file. It's up to you to make sure these contents are EPUB 3 compliant (e.g. a valid XHTML ordered list).

If you're providing your own TOC, triple-check the file references to make sure the relative path is correct (use `EPUBRoot` to help). Also, make sure you point to `xhtml` files, as that's what they'll be in the end, as a result of our `postbuild` step.

### Reading order options?

You can add a `readingOrder` in `pub.json`. It's an array of [fileSlugs](https://www.11ty.io/docs/data/#fileslug) of the files in order. If `readingOrder` is not specified, a reading order gets generated automatically in alphabetical order based on what's in `pages/`. 

All file slugs in a custom reading order have to be for files in `pages/`. 

## Future

There's lots of room for expansion. Some ideas could be:

- Fine tune TOC autogeneration with some options
- Have more TOC templates, for example something with a pagelist.
- Add media overlays (based on what input I'm not sure, maybe some kind of timestamp list)
- more robust build process
  - the XHTML-ification is spread out in a few different places)
  - no control over where files get output (get 11ty's default behavior, e.g. for `chapter1.md`, to output `chapter1/index.html`)
